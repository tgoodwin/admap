On today's internet, ads are typically served from a machine other than the server that hosts the webpage being visited.</br></br>This separation of content serving and ad serving extends the traditional business relationship between media industries and the advertisement industry; two separate entities in collaboration. Website owners allocate ad space to be handled by separate parties on dedicated ad platforms. Typically, these dedicated platforms then processes a user's profile data to render targeted ad experiences in a webpage as it downloads into a user's browser.</br></br>Somewhat ironically, this separation has also enabled relatively simple ad-blocker programs to efficiently purge ads from a user's online experience. When ads are served from separate, dedicated platforms, it's possible to observe patterns in web traffic and identify ad servers by logging web domains seen to consistently serve ad data. Plain and simple domain name blacklists are the core functionality behind the highly effective ad-blockers that are threatening to destablize the internet's ad-based revenue models.</br></br>In the internet's future, ads will likely be integrated into a webpage before it's served to a client, making it much more difficult for a program to discern ads from content as a webpage loads.</br></br>I made <i>my ad net</i> to illustrate the circumstances of a potentially unique period in the evolution of the internet, one where ad-targeted internet users can exploit an advanced but loosely integrated network of ad servers to block their ads for free.</br></br>-tim</div>
