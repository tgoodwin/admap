    <div class="info-panel" ng-show="showInfo"><span class="title">my ad net</span> is a visualization of all the advertisement servers that have exchanged data with my apartment's local network at the time of this page's loading.</br></br>Some background:</br></br>Online ads come as the response to a request made by a user's browser. On today's internet, ad servers are typically separate from the web server that hosts the webpage being visited.</br></br>This separation of content serving and ad serving follows after the traditional business relationship between media industries and the separate advertisement industry. Content producers sell ad space to separate parties who then handle that purchased space on dedicated ad platforms, often processesing a user's profile data to render targeted ad experiences in the user's browser.</br></br>Somewhat ironically, this separation has also been enabling relatively simple ad-blocker programs to efficiently purge ads from a user's online experience. With ads being primarily served from a separate, dedicated platform, it's possible to observe patterns in web traffic and identify ad servers by logging web domains seen to consistently serve ads. Plain and simple domain name blacklists are the core functionality behind the highly effective ad-blockers that are now destabilizing the internet's ad-based revenue models.</br></br>In the internet's future, ads will likely be integrated into a webpage before it's served to a client, making it much more difficult for a program to discern ads from content as a webpage loads.</br></br>I made <i>my ad net</i> to illustrate a potentially unique period in the evolution of the internet - where users can exploit an advanced but unintegrated network of ad servers and block their ads for free.</br></br><span class="right">-tim</span></div>
