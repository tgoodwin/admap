    <span class="sub">It identifies, locates, and records each server that exchanges advertisement data with my apartment's internet connection.</span></br></br></br>Some background:</br></br>
    On today's internet, ads are typically delivered to consumers via online advertising networks, which are companies that connect advertisers to content providers that want to host advertisements. Although ad networks are not limited to online media, the fundamental difference between traditional media ad networks and online ad networks is that online ad networks use centralized computer platforms to deliver advertisements to consumers, enabling targeting, tracking and reporting of impressions in ways not possible with analog media alternatives.</br></br>
    Although <i>well abstracted into the cloud</i>, the underlying infrastructure of an online ad network resembles a collection of servers that process marketing and user profile datasets, rendering and serving ads or 'targeted experiences' to the internet's many users in realtime. As consequence, when a webpage loads, its content and its ads download from different addresses, often held at entirely different physical locations.
    </br></br>
    Ironically, the separation of content serving and ad serving has also enabled users to efficiently filter these ads out using relatively simple ad-blocker programs. When ads are served from separate, dedicated platforms, it's possible to observe patterns in web traffic and identify ad platforms by logging web addresses seen to consistently serve ad data. Plain and simple blacklists are the core functionality behind the highly effective ad-blockers that are beginning to destablize the internet's ad-based revenue models.</br></br>In the internet's future, ads will likely be integrated into webpage content before being served to a client, making it much harder for ad-blockers to discern ads from content as a page loads.</br></br>I made <i>my ad net</a></i> to illustrate the circumstances of a potentially unique period in the internet's evolution, one where internet users can exploit these advanced, yet identifiable ad networks to evade the highly sophisticated ad targeting that increasingly defines the online experience.</br></br><a href="http://tgoodwin.github.io">--Tim</a></div>
