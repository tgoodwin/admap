    On today's internet, ads are typically delivered to internet users via online <i>advertising networks</i>. An advertising network is a company that connects advertisers to content providers that want to host advertisements. Although the term 'ad network' is not limited to online media, the fundamental difference between traditional media ad networks and online ad networks is that online ad networks use centralized ad platforms to deliver advertisements to consumers, which enables targeting, tracking and reporting of impressions in ways not possible with analog media alternatives.</br></br>
    The underlying infrastructure of an online ad network resembles one or multiple servers that process online behavioral data, rendering and serving targeted ad experiences to the internet's many users. Consequently, when a webpage loads, its content and its ads download from different addresses, often held at entirely different physical locations.
    </br></br>
    Ironically, the separation of content serving and ad serving has also enabled relatively simple ad-blocker programs to efficiently filter these ads out of a user's online experience. When ads are served from separate, dedicated platforms, it's possible to observe patterns in web traffic and identify ad servers by logging web addresses seen to consistently serve ad data. Plain and simple blacklists are the core functionality behind the highly effective ad-blockers that are beginning to destablize the internet's ad-based revenue models.</br></br>In the internet's future, ads will likely be integrated into webpage content before being served to a client, making it much harder for ad-blockers to discern ads from content as a page loads.</br></br>I made <i><a href="https://github.com/tgoodwin/my-ad-net">my ad net</a></i> to illustrate the circumstances of a potentially unique period in the internet's evolution, one where internet users can exploit an advanced but separated network of ad servers to evade their targeted ad experiences for free.</br></br><a href="http://github.com/tgoodwin">--tim</a></div>
